Ridge Regression


The wine.csv data describes chemical and ingredient level wine data (eg. sugar, acidity level). Based on these the quality of the wine is selected (on a scale of 3-8). Your task is to predict the quality of the wine according to the following rule: 'good' (rating > 5) & 'bad' (rating <= 5). 

Do the following:

1) conduct exploratory analyis and create hypothesis (which features do you think impact most?)
2) in your exploratory analysis, conclude if data scaling is required or not. 
3) Run the model using the following algos: Logistic Regression, KNN, SGDClassifier and Ridge Regression
4) Analyse the results of each algos results and report a confusion matrix (with precision and recall)
